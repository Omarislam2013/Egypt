        <h2>kushari</h2>
        <p>
            Koshari (also spelled, Kushari) is the national
             dish of my birthplace, Egypt. By far one of my
              favorite things to eat–EVER! No matter how far 
              I’ve traveled, I will always crave a humble bowl 
              of koshari as served in the streets of Egypt.

        <h2>Full w Taameya</h2>
        <p>
            In Egypt, the falafel wich means Taameya equivalent is
            called ta'ameya,
            and it's commonly eaten for breakfast. Ta'ameya is 
            slightly different from traditional falafel because 
            it's made with fava beans instead of only chickpeas. 
            The fava beans make the texture a bit softer on the inside.
            If you are ever visiting Egypt, one of my favorite Ta'ameya
            restaurants is called Zooba. They just recently opened a branch
            in New York City. Another one of my favorite street food
             restaurants in Cairo is called Gad.
